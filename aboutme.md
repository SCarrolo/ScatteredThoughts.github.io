title: About me
---

My name is Sérgio Carrôlo, I am a PhD student studying Quantum field Theory (QFT). I am fascinated by everything, and my goal is to collect some notes about things that I learn during my PhD. I have no organisation in mind, and even no target audience, this is mostly a place where I collect my Scattered thoughts and (try to) write them in an (hopefully) intelligible way.
